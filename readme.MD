### Geojson I/O
When it comes to data saving, a general way of desktop software is using shape file. However, geojson is not only more previaling around internet, but also easier to create an awesome app with open data.

Not only geojson, vector file like svg and table-like data are also supported, includes
 - geojson
 - svg

 - json
 - csv
